Makes life as a tab hoarder easier:
- Lets you search for opened tabs
- Will show audio playing tabs right away
- Can show and close duplicate tabs
- A window or the whole session can be saved to a JSON file. Storing the file somewhere safe and closing the windows is up to you.

Import session file accepts two formats:
- The JSON generated by this plugin
- A basic text file where URLs are separated by newlines

All parsed urls are opened in a new window(s) immidatetly. 

Opening the plugin in a Twitter album opens the url of the current image in background (useful because there's no way to open the image with right-click).


The plugin uses chromes extension apis, so only chromium based browsers might work with it.
To install, you need to enable dev mode in chrome://extensions/ and drag and drop the folder in there.
