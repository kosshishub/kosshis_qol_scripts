If you suffer from tab hoarding, this plugin has multiple features to help you manage and navigate the hell you've created.

Searching
- Lets you search for tabs (very basic string search)
- Can show and close duplicate tabs
- Shows tabs playing audio immediatetly

Session managment
- Lets you store and restore windows (like bookmarks but more intuitive)
- Doesn't remove the restored window from storage. This is a feature, I promise I wasn't lazy.
- Plugin data is stored only locally so google wont know what you're up to (This is a feature too)
- Import/Export feature. Remember to create backups with the export button.

Other wierd things
- Legacy JSON import, don't use
- Opening the plugin in a Twitter album opens the url of the current image in background (there's no way to open the image with right-click).

This plugin is really aimed just for myself, and not ready for public use. Tho it does work well.

To install, you need to enable dev mode in chrome://extensions/ and drag and drop the folder in there.
