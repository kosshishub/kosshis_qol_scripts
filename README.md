## Chrome-plugin

Has few useful features for managing hundreds of tabs:
- Lets you search for tabs
- Can show and close duplicate tabs
- A window or the whole session can be saved to a JSON file. Storing the file somewhere safe and closing the windows is up to you.

Import session file accepts two formats:
- The JSON generated by this plugin
- A basic text file where URLs are separated by newlines

All found urls are opened in a new window immidatetly. 

Tested only on Opera, but should work on most Chromium based browsers.

Opening the plugin in a Twitter album opens the url of the current image in background (there's no way to open the image with right-click).

To install, you need to enable dev mode in chrome://extensions/ and drag and drop the folder in there.
